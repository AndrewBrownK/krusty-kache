Hi zencastr, here is the homework you requested. 

This readme file is an append-only sort of train of thought. Should you browse the git history, you can see both my development, and my thought processes every step of the way.

Here we go. Let's start with the requirements.

> We’d like you to build a caching service, something similar to Redis or Memcachd. The
purpose of this assignment is really an exploration in a problem, there is no right answer.
Perhaps there is a wrong answer :). We think that spending about 3 hours on this assignment
should get you to a good place, but we don’t want to define what is too much or too little.


 
> 1. Build a standalone caching service (choose your language, maybe typescript?)
> 2. You should be able to add item(s), remove items, and fetch items
> 3. The data structure used to store these items is up to you
> 4. The API definitions and formats used to communicate with this API are up to you
> 5. We expect that this service will be runnable, we’ll be able to connect to it, cache things
   and retrieve them.
> 6. PRO TIP: Spending time on the cache internals would be better than spending time on
   the API
> 7. If you are writing this homework in typescript / javascript please make sure there is a
   valid package.json in the root of the repo
> 8. Upload code to a github repo and send back to your Zencastr contact
